Project: Macrophage - This is an extremely thought-intensive game, inspired by the mechanics of
gangrene. The game mechanics rely entirely on the strategic positioning of units.
The game is fun, addictive, easy to learn, and hard to master.

Controls:
Hold right triger and drag cursor to create a selection circle.
Release the trigger to select units.
Move the cursor to a position and press the left trigger and the selected units will move to that area.
Use the B,3,or bumber buttons to allow extended selecting and waypoint creation.

Files:
There should be four files in the folder, including the Read Me:
> - Macrophage.exe: // to make the gadget work this MUST be in the C directory
> - Macrophage Launcher.gg:
> - biocrash3.gmk //code w/ assetts
